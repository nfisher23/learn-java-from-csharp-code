# Learn Java From C#
This is the source code for the book Learn Java From C#, by Nick Fisher. 

The book's sole mission in life is to teach someone Java when said person already has a good grasp on C#. 
Because the languages are largely similar, it would seem silly to re-learn all of C# if all you want to know is some Java.

# Learn Java From C#
This is the source code for the book Learn Java From C#, by Nick Fisher. 

The book's sole mission in life is to teach someone who already has a good grasp on C# learn Java. 
Because the languages are largely similar, it would seem silly to re-learn all of C# if all you want to know is some Java.

The book is available on Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Java-C-Introduction-Spring-ebook/dp/B07NKR2LYY.
